# APITestingwithBruno

API Testing Project with Bruno 

Bruno is a new and innovative API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman and similar tools out there.
Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language, Bru, to save information about API requests
